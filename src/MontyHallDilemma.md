# Monty Hall Dilemma

## Game Show:
* The player is offered to choose one of three closed doors.
* Hidden from the player only one of the door contains a car, while other two are empty.
* After player makes the initial choice, the host opens one of the other two doors.
* The content of which are always empty.
* The player is then offered to, either stick with their initial choice, or switch.
* What strategy, if any, can increase their odds of choosing the door with car hidden behind it.
  
  
  

# Other Thoughts
* The only interesting thing about mathematics is the subject of probability.
  * Or how did a young student, who hated maths, ended up independently deriving Bayes Theorem.
