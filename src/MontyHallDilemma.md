# Monty Hall Dilemma

## The Problem Statement: 
* In a game show:
* The player is offered to choose one of three closed doors.
* Only one door hides a car, while the other two hide a sheep each.
* After player makes the initial choice:
* The host opens one of the other two doors, always revealing a sheep.
* The player is then offered to, either stick with their initial choice, or switch.
* What strategy, if any, can increase their odds of choosing the door with car hidden behind it.


  
  
  

# Other Thoughts
* The only interesting thing about mathematics is the subject of probability.
  * Or how did a young student, who hated maths, ended up independently deriving Bayes Theorem.
